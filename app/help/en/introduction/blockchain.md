## Consensus Mechanism

This Test Net demonstrates a new open source innovation designed by RevPop called "rdPOS" or "Random Delegated Proof Of Stake". A consensus mechanism with 63 pre-elected nodes, but with 21 randomly selected pre-determined nodes serving at any given time, can mean fast transaction speeds along with security, scalability and elected accountability. Due to the maturation of consensus algorithms, along with ongoing innovation and technological improvements, a modern social network, or any modern application for that matter, should have no problem operating on a blockchain technology foundation that functions as a database.

rdPOS behaves like its predecessor, Delegated Proof Of Stake (dPOS). At the final stage, during the vote counting phase, 21 active witnesses are chosen randomly from the list of TOP 63 candidates. This attracts more nodes to the production of blocks while keeping the number of active producers small, speeding up the blockchain.

In essence, the token holders of RevPop (holders of the RVP token) can cast a vote for their preferred block producers on the blockchain. Those so called *witnesses* with the most votes are allowed to produce blocks.

# Voting

> Voting is important in RevPop in the same way it is important to the community in which you live. The weight of your vote is directly correlated to the number of RVP you own. If you aren't heavily involved in the community, you are encouraged to choose a proxy who represents your interests. If you would like to be more involved in the community, check out [our website](https://revolutionpopuli.com/).

## Proxy

You may choose to **not** be active in the governance of RevPop. If this is the case, it's important that you choose someone in the RevPop community who you identify with and set that entity as your proxy. This gives them to the power to vote on your behalf with your RVP shares backing their vote. This is similar to electing a representative.

## Witnesses

Witnesses are entities that work for the blockchain by constructing new blocks. Their role is similar to the role of miners for Bitcoin and other blockchains. Each witness is approved by the token holders and constructs and signs blocks from validated transactions. Every transaction made in the network is required to be validated by all witnesses.

### Consensus Mechanism

Who exactly is allowed to *produce* a block at which time instant is defined by a
consensus mechanism called *Delegated Proof of Stake*. In essence, you, the
token holders of RevPop can cast a vote for your preferred block producers on the blockchain. Those *witnesses* with the most votes are allowed to produce blocks.


## Committee

The committee is a set of entities that are approved by the token holders and set policy for the RevPop blockchain including:

* Transaction and trading fees
* Blockchain parameters, such as block size, block interval
* Referral and vesting parameters such as cash back percentage and vesting periods
